We only have a few (dozen?) objects on the observation schedule here. On
the other hand, the images are rather small.  So, to avoid having to use
huge images, we build a custom index from Gaia DR3 and the known object
centres.  These centres are read from a file that's not in version
control because of priority concerns.

To add more objects, add RA/Dec (decimal) to object.csv, make sure you
have pyvo and astrometry.net installed and then run

  python3 get-calibrators.py

This will fetch calibrators from GAVO's Gaia DR3 lite table for now.
